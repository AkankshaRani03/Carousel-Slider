 This project is about creating a JavaScript Carousel Slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display images with captions and smooth navigation. The development is managed with Git for version control. First, the project files (index.html, style.css, carousel.js) are added to the staging area using git add index.html style.css carousel.js, and then committed with git commit -m "Add initial carousel slider project". Later enhancements, such as adding auto-slide functionality or improving the UI design, are committed with appropriate descriptive messages to maintain clear version history..
