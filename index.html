        <h3>Scrum vs Kanban</h3>
        <p>Kanban teams focus on reducing the time a project takes (or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work. Scrum teams commit to completing an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set intervals called sprints.</p>
